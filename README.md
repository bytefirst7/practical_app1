**Solution:**

When asked the question to predict if a driver would accept a coupon by visualizing the data, I had to consider analyzing the data using a variety of conditions and combinations of conditions. In total I used 5 conditions with sub-conditions to predict if drivers would accept a coupon. The conditions are as follows:

**1. Category Coupon Bar:**

	Acceptance rate for drivers who accepted coupons to the Bar
		a. Total 'bar' coupons: 2017, Accepted 'bar' coupons: 827, Acceptance rate: 41.00%
		a. Acceptance rate for drivers who went to the bar 3 times or less, compared with drivers who went to the bar more than 3 times.
			3_times_or_less       37.07%
			4_times_or_greater    76.88%
	Outcome / Hypothesis: 
		Drivers as a whole did not accept the bar coupons, they only accepted them at a rate of 41%. However drivers who were over the age of 25 were are more likely to accept the bar coupon.
  
**2. Category Coupon Coffee House:**

	Acceptance rate for drivers who accepted coupons to the Coffee House:
		a. Total 'coffee house' coupons: 3996, Accepted 'coffee house' coupons: 1995, Acceptance rate: 49.92%
		b. Acceptance rate for driver who went to the coffee house 3 times or less, compared with drivers who went to the coffee house more than 3 times.
			3_times_or_less       44.96
			4_times_or_greater    67.50
		b. Acceptance rate for frequent coffee-goers (age > 25): 63.84%. Acceptance rate for all others: 42.76%
		c. Acceptance rate for driver who go to the coffee house more than once a month and had adult passengers and have occupations other than farming, fishing, or forestry: 66.08%
		d. Acceptance rate for drivers who go to the coffee house more than once a month, had adult passengers and were not widowed: 66.08%
		e. Acceptance rate for drivers who go to the coffee house more than once a month, and are under the age of 30: 69.08%
	Outcome / Hypothesis:
		Drivers who went to the coffee house more than 3 times a month were more likely to accept the coffee house coupon.
  
**3. Category Coupon <20 Restaurants:**

	Acceptance rate of drivers who went to restaurants that cost less than $20:
		a. Total '<20 Restaurants' coupons: 2786, Accepted '<20 Restaurants' coupons: 1970, Acceptance rate: 70.71%
		b. Acceptance rate for frequent <20 restaurant-goers (age > 25): 70.15%
		c. Acceptance rate for all others: 71.60%
		d. Acceptance rate for driver who go to <20 restaurants more than once a month and had adult passengers and have occupations other than farming, fishing, or forestry: 71.40%
		e. Acceptance rate for drivers who go to <20 restaurants more than once a month, had adult passengers and were not widowed: 71.51%
		f. Acceptance rate for drivers who go to <20 restaurants more than once a month, and are under the age of 30: 74.91%
	Outcome / Hypothesis:
		The overall acceptance rate for restaurants that cost less than 20 dollars is very high.
  
**4. Category Coupon Carry Out:**

	Acceptance rate of drivers who went to restaurants and carry out their meal:
		a. Total 'Carry out' coupons: 2393, Accepted 'Carry out' coupons: 1760, Acceptance rate: 73.55%
		b. Acceptance rate for frequent carry out-goers (age > 25): 74.75%
		c. Acceptance rate for all others: 71.56%
		d. Acceptance rate for driver who carry out more than once a month and had adult passengers and have occupations other than farming, fishing, or forestry: 74.64%
		e. Acceptance rate for drivers who carry out more than once a month, had adult passengers and were not widowed: 74.48%
		f. Acceptance rate for drivers who carry out more than once a month, and are under the age of 30: 73.41%
	Outcome / Hypothesis:
		The overall acceptance rate for restaurants that cost less than 20 dollars is very high.
  
**5. Category Coupon for Restaurants that cost between 20 and 50 dollars:**

	Acceptance rate of drivers who went to restaurants that cost between 20 and 50 dollars:
		a. Total 'Restaurant cost between 20-50 dollars' coupons: 1492, Accepted 'Restaurant cost between 20-50 dollars' coupons: 658, Acceptance rate: 44.10%
		b. Acceptance rate for frequent restaurants goers that paid between 20 and 50 dollars (age > 25): 55.67%
		c. Acceptance rate for all others: 39.91%
		d. Acceptance rate for driver who went to restaurants that cost between 20 and 50 dollars more than once a month and had adult passengers and have occupations other than farming, fishing, or forestry: 57.56%
		e. Acceptance rate for drivers who went to restaurants that cost between 20 and 50 dollars more than once a month, had adult passengers and were not widowed: 57.56%
		f. Acceptance rate for drivers who went to restaurants that cost between 20 and 50 dollars more than once a month, and are under the age of 30: 58.98%
	Outcome / Hypothesis:
		The overall acceptance rate for restaurants that cost between 20 and 50 dollars is low.

**Final Outcome:**

	Overall I would say driver are more likely accept a coupon.
